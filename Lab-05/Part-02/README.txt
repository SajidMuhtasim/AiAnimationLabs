● STUDENT NAME: Sajid Muhtasim
● NOTES ON SUBMISSION: 

I chose to analyze the 12:04-12:18 section. I notice the use of IK when the character is jumping down, the arms and hands seem to move towards the ledge of the building (around 12:10 mark). This seems to be common for other ledges as well. So thats where the IK target would be, and the pole would be the elbow. The chain length I believe is 2. 

I wasn't able to recreate the animation as I hoped to, I am not sure how to make it so the IK target only affects one animation and stops when another animation is playing.
